1. Assigned Feature
Number 6 - Version Control Manager

Version control is literally what GIT is designed to do. Version control 
systems like GIT manage changes to source code over time keeping 
track of every modification to the code.
The job of a version control manager goes beyond the basic functions 
of GIT. A version control manager is responsible for managing changes 
to documents, computer programs and all other aspects of a products 
different releases (or “versions”).
For this class the version control manager is responsible for the final 
release of your team’s project onto a number of different platforms.
Each platform is a different release, so while I have been insisting that 
everyone keep all the code in the master branch, you get to break the 
trend and create a separate branch for each release that you are 
targeting.

Continue to develop your feature.
Software Development Specialists deliverables: 
As a group:
? Choose one of the team’s games that would run well on the 
Vive or any virtual reality platform you have access to and can 
bring to class. Update the controls to run with the controls of 
the virtual reality environment.
? Choose one of the team’s games to run on a cell phone. Update 
the controls to be haptic controls. (I.e. you would move the 
main player by tilting your phone the direction you want to go 
rather than pushing a button.
? Choose a third platform of your choice to deploy a game to.
As an individual for your team:
? A ½ page user’s manual suitable to have on the desks at the 
final presentations showing a brief description of the game 
(similar to the description in the poster), and the basic 
commands. Do this even if the information is available in the 
game itself.
? A readme file for the teams at the other sites with instructions 
on how to load and run the executable of your game on their 
computer with minimal set-up.
? Create an executable for your contact at the other site to run 
during the final demo.
Software Development Specialists Presentation: 
? Using the tools available, demonstrate how to deploy code to 
different platforms, and discuss the issues involved with each.
? Demo code running on at least three different platforms.
? Choose a volunteer who is not on the team that wrote the code 
and show them the team’s user’s manual and have them use it 
to play a game. 
? Go over all the work items remaining in this course including:
o Ethics
o Oral Exam
o Post Mortem
o Pair Programing
o Final Demo
Add to your Team Lead Presentation: 
? Show your team’s user’s manual and readme file (soft copy)
