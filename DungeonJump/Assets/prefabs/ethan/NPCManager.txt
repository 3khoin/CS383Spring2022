Name: NPCManager
Summary: An instance of the NPCManager and JSONReader class
Description: This prefab can be dragged and dropped onto any scene to create an instance of the NPCManager and the 
JSONReader scripts. These scripts are necessary for the use of the NPCFriendly prefabs UI and serialized dialogue. This
prefab finds and identifies the UI elements necessary to display the dialogue on the UI, as well as identifies any 
progress blockers that may be in the scene so that quest triggers in the dialogue can remove the blockers. Note that 
it is assumed that there is only one or zero progress blockers in a level. This is done upon the loading of the script instance.
