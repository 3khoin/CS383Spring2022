Name: NPCFriendly
Summary: A non hostile 2D NPC which the player can interact with
Description: The NPCFriendly class is a prefab of the FriendlyNPC class. This class consists of a dialogue subclasses as
a decorator for how many dialogue options you wish the player to have when talking with the NPC as well as a separate 
dialog class for the dialog trees. This prefab will trigger a conversation with the player when the player enters the
NPCs collider and end the conversation upon leaving.

This prefab is able to serialize a .json file and create dialogue trees for the NPC. The structure of the json files 
must mirror the dialog class to be able to be properly read without any errors. Quest begin and end triggers can be 
specified in the dialogue as well as the dialogue path.

Note that all dialogue 1 options will end the interaction, so be aware of that while creating the dialogue trees.
The pre made check environment script by default returns to the 3nd dialogue option when a quest item has been gathered,
and returns to the fourth when the tile blocker has been cleared out from the scene. This removes teh need for a 
separate class to hold the current id.
