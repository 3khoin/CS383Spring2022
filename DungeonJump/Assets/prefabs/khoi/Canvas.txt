Copyright issues: The included songs were copyrighted for games that have already been published commercially, yet we are digitally transmitted them as sound recordings in our game without permission.
- Integration: I used their MP3s in the Audio Manager.
- Legal implications: Marketing our code with the given audio may violate copyright, as it will have been a violation of a commercial nature using a creative work in its entirety.
- Fair use: Even though the audio is identical to the original copyrighted work, this unlicensed use of the song in no way creates competition with the original work.
