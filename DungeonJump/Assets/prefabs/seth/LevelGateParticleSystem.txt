Name: LevelGateParticleSystem
Summary: A particle system with an upward, looping, random flow of small particles.
Description: Great for entryway special effects, this standalone particle system can be placed anywhere in the scene.
		     It consists of and has the following characteristics:
				 An empty gameobject with a Particle System attached. 
				 The particles travel just under 2.5 units in the Y-direction before dissipating. 
				 The particles lose speed due to the system's gravity modifier of 0.5, adjustable under the main "LevelGateParticleSystem".
				 The particle system doesn't have rigidbody enabled for collisions.
				 The default particle system material is used and can be adjusted under "Renderer".
				 Radius is set to 0.5 and can be easily adjusted under "Shape".
			For more information about Unity's builtin particle system, see the 
				Unity documentation https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/ParticleSystem.html.
