# HexBoyz Coding Standards
The coding standards below are the standards we here at HexBoyz expect all of our code to follow regarding names, whitespace, and file format.
## Indentation
Each new level of code signaled by the presence of a { on the preveous line should be indented using 4 spaces and decremented by 4 spaces at the } character. Tabs should be avoided.
